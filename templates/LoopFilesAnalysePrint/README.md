# VBA Macro ‚Äì Print Analytics of Files

## üìå Overview
The **`PrintAnalyticsofFiles`** macro automates the process of:
1. Looping through all Excel files (`*.xls`) in a specified folder.
2. Extracting raw data from each file.
3. Feeding the data into a pre-defined **Print** worksheet.
4. Automatically printing the **UsedRange** (configured to print as PDF or physical printer).

This is especially useful for **batch-printing reports** or **generating multiple PDFs** from a collection of Excel files without manual effort.

## ‚ú® Features
- Loops through all `.xls` files in a target folder.
- Clears and reloads raw data dynamically for each file.
- Prints the **UsedRange** from a formatted `Print` sheet.
- Automatically records:
  - ‚úÖ **Start time**
  - ‚úÖ **End time**
  - ‚úÖ **Execution duration**
  - ‚úÖ **User running the macro**
- Integrated with `Dashboard` sheet for file path input and logging.

     - `C10` ‚Üí Displays current file being processed.
   - **RawData**
     - Temporary data dump from each file.

## üöÄ Usage
1. Enter the **folder path** containing `.xls` files in `Dashboard!C16`.
2. Run the macro:
   ```vba
   Call PrintAnalyticsofFiles
   ```
3. The macro will:
- Process each file in sequence.
- Print reports based on the Print sheet.
- Log execution details.

## Example Workflow
- Folder contains: Sales_Jan.xls, Sales_Feb.xls, Sales_Mar.xls
- For each file:
  - Data copied into RawData.
  - Print sheet recalculates.
  - Report is printed.
- Loop continues until all files are processed.
- Final message box confirms completion: "Print done"

## üõ† Customization
- Change Range("A:AZ") to adjust which columns of data are imported.
- Update .UsedRange.PrintOut if you want:
  - Preview instead of print.
  - Export to PDF via ExportAsFixedFormat.
